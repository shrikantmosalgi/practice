Q.what is lamda?
-> It is anonymous function which has no Name,no modifier,no return type
eg. ()->{
        }
- it reduces lines of code
- we can use Lamda expression with only functional interface, without functional inerface we can not use lamda expression      
- if body of lamda expression contains only one statement then curly braces are optional
- java compiler enter the type of variable passed in argument, hence type is optional
