Q.what is lamda?
-> It is anonymous function which has no Name,no modifier,no return type
eg. ()->{
        }
- it reduces lines of code
- we can use Lamda expression with only functional interface, without functional inerface we can not use lamda expression      
- if body of lamda expression contains only one statement then curly braces are optional
- java compiler enter the type of variable passed in argument, hence type is optional 

Q.functional interface
-> if interface contains only one abstract method then it is functional interface
-to call lamda we require functional interface
- lamda is used to implement functional interface only, if interface has multiple methods then we have to use anonymous class
eg.Runnabe,Callale,Comparable  

##Stream Api
- These streams are related to collection framework(Group of object)
-these are diffrent from IO streams, IO streams are sequence of data, IO streams are used to write data

##method Reference 
-this is special type of lamda expression
-this is used to create simple lamda expressions by referencing existing methods
- symbol is  ::
-types of method references
1.static methods 2.instance methods of perticular objects 3.constructor
